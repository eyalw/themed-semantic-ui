# Semantic-UI customization config

* put css that overrides themes in '\*.overrides' files
* put variables that affect existing css in '\*.variables' files
* Make sure to run build or watch to see results
```
npm run semantic-ui-build
or
npm run semantic-ui-watch
```
* To add new customizations, look at an example /site folder in the website. it has many many empty files. We removed them and left only the ones we actually use. Bring back new ones you need to edit
